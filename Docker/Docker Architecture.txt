## Docker Architecture ## 

# Docker Client: 
The command-line tool (or API) used by users to interact with Docker. It sends requests to the Docker Daemon to manage containers and images.

# Docker Daemon: 
The background service responsible for managing Docker containers. It handles container runtime operations, such as starting, stopping, and monitoring containers.

# Docker Images: 
Snapshots or templates of an application and its dependencies, packaged into a single file. Images are used to create containers. Images are often stored in Docker Registries.

# Docker Containers: 
Running instances of Docker images. Containers are isolated, lightweight environments that include everything needed to run an application, such as the code, runtime, system libraries, and settings.

# Docker Registries: 
Repositories that store and distribute Docker images. The most commonly used registry is Docker Hub, but organizations can set up private registries for security and control.

# Union File System: 
A technology that allows Docker to create layers of read-only images on top of each other. This layered approach enables efficient image creation, sharing, and storage.

# Dockerfile: 
A text file containing instructions to build a Docker image. Dockerfiles define the application's environment, dependencies, and how to configure the image.

# Docker Compose: 
A tool for defining and managing multi-container applications. It uses a YAML file to describe services, networks, and volumes, simplifying the orchestration of complex setups.

#Docker Swarm / Kubernetes: 
Orchestration tools that manage the deployment, scaling, and management of containers across a cluster of machines. They provide features for high availability, load balancing, and automated scaling.
