# 🐳Docker Architecture: Components and Capabilities


#### 👩‍💻 Docker Client:
This command-line tool receives instructions from users and orchestrates requests to the Docker Daemon.

#### 🛠️ Docker Daemon:
The background service responsible for managing Docker containers. It handles container runtime operations, such as starting, stopping, and monitoring containers.

#### 🖼️ Docker Images:
Snapshots or templates of an application and its dependencies, packaged into a single file. Images are used to create containers. Images are often stored in Docker Registries.

#### 📦 Docker Containers: 
Running instances of Docker images. Containers are isolated, lightweight environments that include everything needed to run an application, such as the code, runtime, system libraries, and settings.
####  🏢 Docker Registries:
Repositories that store and distribute Docker images. The most commonly used registry is Docker Hub, but organizations can set up private registries for security and control.

#### Union File System: 
A technology that allows Docker to create layers of read-only images on top of each other. This layered approach enables efficient image creation, sharing, and storage.

####  📝 Dockerfile: 
A text file containing instructions to build a Docker image. Dockerfiles define the application's environment, dependencies, and how to configure the image.

####  🤝 Docker Compose:
A tool for defining and managing multi-container applications. It uses a YAML file to describe services, networks, and volumes, simplifying the orchestration of complex setups.

#### 🌟 Docker Swarm / Kubernetes:
Orchestration tools that manage the deployment, scaling, and management of containers across a cluster of machines. They provide features for high availability, load balancing, and automated scaling.
