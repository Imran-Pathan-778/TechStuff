# Git and GitHub 

Understanding the details of Git and GitHub is essential for efficient collaboration on software projects.


## Git :

Git is a version control system. Imagine you are working on a document and you make changes over time. Sometimes you want to go back to a previous version to see what it looked like or to undo some mistakes you made. Git does that for software projects. It keeps track of all the changes made to the files in your project, allowing you to view, revert or merge those changes easily.


### Example 
Think of an IT project you're working on. You start with an empty codebase, write a few lines of code, and save it as Version 1. Then you add more features and improvements, saving it as Version 2. If you encounter issues or want to undo the changes made in Version 2, Git allows you to revert back to Version 1 effortlessly. This makes it easier to manage and collaborate on the project with your team.


## GitHub :
GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git to help developers work together on software projects. It provides a remote location (a server on the internet) where you can store your Git repositories (collections of files and their version history) and collaborate with others.


### Example

Let's say you and your colleagues are working on an IT project together. Each team member is responsible for a different module or feature and instead of sharing code through emails or messages, you use GitHub. You create a shared repository on GitHub, and each person can make their changes independently on their own branches. The platform keeps track of everyone's contributions and makes it easy to merge their changes together into one cohesive and functional IT project. This way, collaboration becomes more efficient, and everyone can work together seamlessly to build the final product 

## Version control system and its types

Version control is a system that tracks and manages changes to files or a project over time. It allows users to revert to previous versions, collaborate effectively, and maintain a history of modifications.

#### There are two main types of version control systems:

- Centralized Version Control System (CVCS): Has a central server to store versions, and users work directly with the server.

- Distributed Version Control System (DVCS): Gives each user a complete repository, enabling offline work and independent operations, with changes synced between repositories.

- Examples:
  
  CVCS: Apache Subversion (SVN), Perforce.
  
  DVCS: Git, Mercurial.
